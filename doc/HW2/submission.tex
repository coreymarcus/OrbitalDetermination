\abstract{This homework demonstrates that our propagator accurately accounts for J2 and drag effects on spacecraft motion.}

\section{Introduction}

The dominant force acting on a spacecraft in motion is usually known as point-mass gravity. However, there are higher order effects which must be accounted for. The Earth is not a point-mass, there is bulging around the equator which alters the gravity field. This effect is commonly referred to as J2. We model and account for it in this homework. In addition, the Earth's atmosphere extends far beyond the Karman Line. This causes atmospheric drag forces on the spacecraft. We model and account for these in this homework as well. \\

\section{Problem One}

\subsection{a}

Derivation of J2...

\subsection{b}

Figure \ref{fig:OE} shows the evolution of six orbital elements; $a$, $e$, $i$, $\Omega$, $\omega$, and $T_p$ over the course of one day. All orbital elements exhibit some variation over the course of the day. As expected, only variations in $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are significant. There is a relatively constant change in the right ascension of the ascending node, $\Omega$, over the course of the day. This change is commonly leveraged to produce orbits which are sun-synchronous. \\

The argument of periapsis, $\omega$, also exhibits significant oscillations centered around 90 degrees. This is caused by J2 providing a psuedo-torque on the vehicle which rotates the orbit back and forth as it circles the planet. \\

	\label{fig:OE}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:OrbitPeriod} shows the evolution of the orbital period, $P$. $P$ remains relatively constant, instantaneously varying by less than 20 seconds over the course of the orbit. This does tell us that instantaneous calculations of $P$ do have some inaccuracy, and J2 must be modeled to provide a more accurate estimate of $P$. \\

	\caption{The orbital period over the course of one day while modeling J2.}
	\label{fig:OrbitPeriod}
\end{figure}

\subsection{c}

Figure \ref{fig:energy} shows the change in specific energy of the spacecraft over the course of one day while modeling J2. We note that it is almost constant, and most errors are likely due to the finite tolerances of our numerical integrator. Therefore, we conclude that J2 does not cause the spacecraft's potential and kinetic energy to be converted to other forms such as thermal. \\

\end{figure}

\subsection{d}

Angular momentum

\section{Problem 2}

\subsection{a}

Figure \ref{fig:energydrag} shows the change in specific energy of the spacecraft while modeling J2 and atmospheric drag forces. We note a clear decline in the specific energy of the spacecraft over time. This can be contrasted with the nearly constant specific energy demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:energy}. From this, we can conclude that drag forces remove kinetic and potential energy from the spacecraft. If these are the only forms of energy considered, then energy is not conserved. However, from a wider frame of view, this lost energy is certainly converted into some other form such as thermal and the total amount of energy in the universe is conserved. \\

	\caption{caption}
	\label{fig:energydrag}
\end{figure}

\subsection{b}

Figure \ref{fig:dOE} compares the orbital elements found while modeling drag and J2 to those found while modeling J2 only. From this plot we see that the main component effected by drag is semi-major axis, $a$. This is because drag removes energy from the orbit and thus lowers its altitude. \\
